The correct way of creating a private fork by duplicating the repo is documented here. Suppose the repository you wish to private fork is KPMS-IT4I-EX.

Create a bare clone of the repository. (This is temporary and will be removed so just do it wherever.)
```{sh eval=FALSE}
git clone --bare https://github.com/RBigData/KPMS-IT4I-EX.git
```
Create a new private repository on your Github account and name it KPMS-IT4I-EX.

Mirror-push your bare clone to your new repository.

Replace <your_username> with your actual GitHub username in the url below.
```{sh eval=FALSE}
cd KPMS-IT4I-EX
git push --mirror htps://github.com/<your_username>/KPMS-IT4I-EX.git
```
Remove the temporary local repository you created in step 1.
```{sh eval=FALSE}
cd ..
rm -rf KPMS-IT4I-EX
```
You can now clone your private KPMS-IT4I-EX repository on your machine.
```{sh eval=FALSE}
cd ~/where-you-want-the-repostory
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/KPMS-IT4I-EX.git
```
Add the original repo as remote to fetch (potential) future changes. Make sure you also disable push on the remote (as you are not allowed to push to it anyway).
```{sh eval=FALSE}
git remote add upstream https://github.com/RBigData/KPMS-IT4I-EX.git
git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE
```
You can list all your remotes with `git remote -v`. You should see:
```{sh eval=FALSE}
origin	https://github.com/<your_username>/KPMS-IT4I-EX.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/<your_username>/KPMS-IT4I-EX.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/RBigData/KPMS-IT4I-EX.git (fetch)
upstream	DISABLE (push)
```
When you push, do so on origin with git push origin.

When you want to pull changes from upstream you can fetch the remote and rebase on top of your work.
```{sh eval=FALSE}
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```
And solve the conflicts if any.
